Usage:
  NEWTON: (newton's method)
    Approximates the zeros of a function given a function, a starting x value, and the number of iterations. Enter the function as
    y1 in the calculator. Then, run in the program and fill in necessary information where prompted. 
    
   EULER: (Euler's method)
    Approximates the y value of a function at a certain x value given the target x value, the initial x value, the "step" (distance 
    between the x values of each iteration), the y value of the function at the initial x value, and the derivative equation of the
    function. Enter the derivative equation as y1. Replace ys in the equation with the Z variable (example: f'(x) = xy -> f'(x) = xZ).
    Then run the program and input the other neccessary information where prompted.
